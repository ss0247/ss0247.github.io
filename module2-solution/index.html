            <p class="content">
                A thin pancake, dosa is crepe-like and slightly sweeter than naan. Coming from the southern part of India, it’s usually made from rice and lentils. Usually eaten hot, dipped in various chutneys, as an accompaniment to a curry meal. But sometimes dosas are stuffed with veggies and eaten as snacks. Masala dosa, for example, is filled with spiced potatoes.

            <p class="content">
                This popular Indian dessert is based on two flavors – gulab (which means rose) and jamun (which refers to purple jamun berries, similar to blueberries). Using milk solids and flour, the dessert consists of small doughy balls soaked in rose water and green cardamom. Think of it like Indian doughnuts dipped in mouth-watering syrup!

            <p class="content">
                ‘Malai’ means cream and ‘Kofta’ are fried balls of various ingredients, popular not only in Indian cuisine, but also in Middle Eastern, Balkan and Asian meals as well. Malai Kofta is a delicious dish of fried balls of potato and paneer in a rich and creamy mild gravy made with sweet onions and tomatoes. This melt-in-your-mouth recipe is a labor of love, but one that is well worth it.
